ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Li Ko!

I have been working in the Education field for about 5 years and I enjoy every moment of it.
I usually spend my free time learning a new skill.

Things I'm working on at the moment:
- Python
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

My focus is on analysing large sets of data and creating machine learning models with the goal to help better business decisions.
